# There is a row of N walls in Geeksland. 
# The king of Geeksland ordered Alexa to color all the walls on the occasion of New Year. 
# Alexa can color each wall with either pink, black, or yellow.

# , where colors[i][0], colors[i][1], and colors[i][2] is the cost of painting ith wall with colors pink, black, and yellow respectively.
# You need to find the minimum cost to color all the walls such that no two adjacent walls have the same color
