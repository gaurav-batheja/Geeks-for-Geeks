# Geek is in a geekland which have a river and some stones in it.
# Initially geek can step on any stone.
# Each stone has a number on it representing the value of exact step geek can move.
# If the number is +ve then geeks can move right and if the number is -ve then geeks can move left.
# Bad Stones are defined as the stones in which if geeks steps, will reach a never ending loop 
# whereas good stones are the stones which are safe from never ending loops.
# Return the number of good stones in river.
